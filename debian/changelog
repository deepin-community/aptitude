  * Add a debian/gitlab-ci.yml file.
  * Override upstream-metadata-file-is-missing lintian warning as it
    doesn't make sense to have a less informative copy (without branch
    information) of the Vcs-* headers in there again. It just causes work
    because the Lintian Janitor bot files useless merge requests.

aptitude (0.8.13-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release. Please see /usr/share/aptitude/NEWS for a change
    log with more details.

    - Internal changes:
      * Import patches by Julian Andres Klode from the 0.8.12-2 and
        0.8.12-3 uploads. Related to changes in apt 1.9.x.
      * Switch from libparse-debianchangelog-perl to libdpkg-perl.
        (Patch by Guillem Jover; Closes: #934135)
      * Rename README to README.DOCUMENTATION.

    - Translation updates:
      * po/nl.po: Dutch program translation by Frans Spiesschaert (Closes:
        #909687, #950541, #955506)
      * aptitude-defaults.ru: Russian sections translation by Sergey
        Alyoshin (Closes: #914786)
      * doc/po4a/po/it.po: Italian documentation translation by Beatrice
        Torracca (Closes: #959895)
      * doc/po4a/po/fr.po: French documentation translation by
        Jean-Pierre Giraud (Closes: #942094)

  * Packaging changes needed for new upstream release:
    + Recommend libdpkg-perl instead of libparse-debianchangelog-perl.
    + Install aptitude-changelog-parser into aptitude-common.
    + Drop patches from the 0.8.12-2 and 0.8.12-3 uploads.

  * Work around FTBFS with po4a 0.58. (See #960892, closes: #960865)
    + This is deemed to be a temporary fix until po4a is fixed. It is not
      merged into the upstream release on purpose to keep that working
      independent of the build directory's location and to be easily
      removable once #960892 is fixed.
  * Rename debian/README.Debian to debian/README.source and update it
    with regards to git repository URLs.
  * Bump debhelper compatibility level to 13.
    + Build-depend on "debhelper-compat (= 13)" to replace debian/compat.
    + Disable dh_missing, we generate some file lists dynamically.
  * Declare compliance with Debian Policy 4.5.0. (No changes needed.)
  * Apply "wrap-and-sort -a".
  * Add lintian overrides for "uses-dpkg-database-directly" due to
    aptitude-*-state-bundle: These are debugging tools and do nothing but
    capture the state of the dpkg database whatever it looks like.
  * Create a debian/.gitignore file to ignore package build artifacts.

aptitude (0.8.12-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release. Please see /usr/share/aptitude/NEWS for a change
    log with more details.

    - New features:
      * Permit to retrieve changelogs of packages from Debian Ports
        repositories.
      * Adapt for changes in apt 1.9, like addressing deprecation and API
        changes.  Thanks to Julian Andres Klode.

    - Bug fixes:
      * Adapt code to adapt to change of behaviour in Boost.MultiIndex
        library, and so we can start using Boost >= 1.66, 1.67 is about to
        become the default in Debian unstable.  Thanks to Julian Andres Klode.
      * Fix crashes when Label of a repository is empty (Closes: #907436)
      * Fix changelog downloads
      * Read the correct number of elements in
        pkg_item::pkg_columnizer::init_formatting() -- it was ignoring the last
        element, reading only 25 out of 26.

    - Internal changes:
      * Misc. fixes about deprecation issues and minor compilation problems


  * Bump build-dependencies on cwidget to >= 0.5.18, that implies a
    library transition.  This ensures that aptitude is built against the
    latest cwidget ABI in the buildds.
  * d/patches, drop all patches because they are fixed in the upstream code:
    - changelogs-debian-ports.patch
    - fix-changelog-retrieval.patch
    - fix-crash-907436.patch
    - support-boost1.67.patch
  * Ensure that it builds in unstable with all the GCC compiler and
    library changes (Closes: #935615)

  * Add a bunch of generated documentation XML files to debian/clean.

 -- Axel Beckert <abe@debian.org>  Thu, 14 Feb 2019 01:51:08 +0100

aptitude (0.8.11-6) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Build-Depends: do not require Boost version 1.67 or greater:
    - boost-defaults already points to 1.67 on most arches so we don't need
      to ensure that aptitude builds against that version after the needed
      fix
    - and boost1.67 fails to build in some architectures and aptitude is
      used as resolver in some builders, so it's important to keep things
      working even if it's built against an older boost

 -- Manuel A. Fernandez Montecelo <mafm@debian.org>  Sun, 18 Nov 2018 22:58:28 +0100

aptitude (0.8.11-5) unstable; urgency=medium

      not been removed yet as build-dependency in d/control)
    - Add Boost::System, it was already used before but it needs to be
      pulled in explicitly now
  * d/patches:
    - add changelogs-debian-ports.patch to allow to view changelogs of packages
      from Debian Ports repositories
    - add support-boost1.67.patch to support Boost >= 1.66, problems due
      to change of behaviour in Boost.MultiIndex library.  Thanks to Julian
      Andres Klode.

aptitude (0.8.10-6) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Bump Breaks/Replaces of aptitude-common to aptitude (<< 0.8.10-4) from
    an ancient version 0.6.8-1, because in 0.8.10-4 we moved the manpages
    from the main package to -common without adding these changes.

aptitude (0.8.10-5) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Release to unstable
  * Also move po4a to Build-Depends-Indep, only needed for doc translations

 -- Manuel A. Fernandez Montecelo <mafm@debian.org>  Mon, 15 Jan 2018 18:25:17 +0100

aptitude (0.8.10-4) experimental; urgency=medium

  * Improve builds using -indep/-arch and skipping docs for -arch
    + Move doc-related dependencies to Build-Depends-Indep, create
      separate -indep/-arch targets.

      In this way we can disable building the docs for each arch; and
      obtain huge savings in terms of resources (time, disk, network),
      because some of these dependencies pull lots of packages.

      The doc-related dependencies are:
      - docbook-xml
      - docbook-xsl
      - elinks
      - librsvg2-bin
      - xsltproc

    + Move man pages to aptitude-common, it's depended on by the binary
      package and so we save ~200KB in the arch packages.

      The biggest saving is that we can avoid building docs in -arch and
      having to pull the dependencies explained in 1).

    + Disable tests for boost headers at configure time.

      They take 30~50 seconds in fast computers, and haven't failed for a
      few years, so they provide very little value.  If there's something
      wrong, the compilations will fail only a few seconds later.

      In any case, they could pass the initial test and fail later anyway,
      Boost libraries sometimes change APIs in incompatible ways.

  * Remove special workaround in d/rules due to bug #580085 from 2010 in
    s390 (now superseded by s390x) and sh4, forcing "gcc -fno-gcse"
    (optimisation enabled by default at levels -O2, -O3 and -Os)

    - User visible changes (Resolver):
      This subsection is to separate the (many) changes of the Resolver in this

      (NEWS).

      Executive summary:
      * Changes to the order in which solutions are offered in conflict
        resolutions, so upgrades or keeps are preferred over removal of many
        packages
        (Closes: #341963, #359171, #365644, #453935, #569315, #570377, #574132,
                 #588202, #610845, #651410, #651947, #653284, #661678, #722211,
                 #798240)

      A more detailed description of individual changes follows:
      * Modify several resolver scores config variables
          ::ProblemResolver::RequiredScore  = 8  (was: 4)
          ::ProblemResolver::ImportantScore = 4  (was: 5)
          ::ProblemResolver::StandardScore  = 2  (was: 3)
          ::ProblemResolver::OptionalScore  = 1
          ::ProblemResolver::ExtraScore     = 0  (was: -1)
      * Add new score for removal of obsolete package and corresponding config
        variable ::ProblemResolver::RemoveObsoleteScore
        Default to 310 to allow for easier upgrades and to counter the penalty
        to remove packages (default -300).
      * Add new score for partial solutions cancelling the removal of a package
        and corresponding config variable ::ProblemResolver::CancelRemovalScore
        Resolver actions cancelling the removal (or purge) of a package
        requested to be removed/purged were not being penalised, now they are
        (default -300).
      * Only add Preserve{Auto,Manual}Score if the packages are actually
        installed
        Without this, the algorithm was assigning extra score +60 (default
        PreserveManualScore) for packages which remained uninstalled
        (were not to be installed) and when the user actually didn't select
        them manually -- even if the justification was "because it is the
        to-be-installed version of a manually installed package".
      * Change the default score of several ::ProblemResolver config variables
        * ::StepScore to -10 (was +70)
        * ::PreserveManualScore to +20 (was +60)
        * ::UpgradeScore to +30 (was 0)
        * ::Keep-All-Level to 10000 (was 20000)
      * Change how the costs are compared
      * Apply InstallScore and UpgradeScore also when the packages are not
        "manual"

    - Internal changes:
      * configure.ac: Allow to disable check for Boost library headers
        individually
      * Avoid extra code calling apt_load_cache() when already loaded
      * [cmdline] Rejecting a solution advances to the next one only

        boilerplates

      * manpage:
        * Minor clarification about "install" example (Closes: #268698)

      * Actually enable Dutch (nl) documentation translation by Frans
        Spiesschaert

  * d/control: Drop Build-dependencies present for a long time but which
    haven't been used in the last few years:
    - libboost-python-dev
    - libboost-serialization-dev

  [ Axel Beckert ]
  * Demote Recommends on HTML documentation to Suggests. (Closes: #820452)
  * Declare compliance with Debian Policy 3.9.8. (No changes needed.)

aptitude (0.7.1-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release.
    - Bug fixes:
      * Fix for wrong reported size of deleted files with 'autoclean' on
        32-bit arches (Closes: #499872)
      * Be explicit when packages are already installed, cannot be
        removed/purged because they are not installed, and similar
        (Closes: #421469).
      * Check string formats for columns in both curses and command line
        interface, and forbid characters which can lead to cwidget
        assertions and program crashes.  (Closes: #497129, #532662).
    - Documentation:
      * Quick help (help.txt):
        * Document 'l' (Limit Display) in quick help (Closes: #514541)
        * Improve description of '_' (Purge) (Closes: #495326)
        * Improve the description of the search shortcut, and point more
          clearly to search patterns in the full documentation
      * man page:
        * Fix example of '-F' with current and candidate versions
          (Closes: #752517)
      * Guide/User's Manual:
        * Upgrade doc/??/aptitude.xml documents from DocBook XML 4.2 to
          4.5
        * Use XHTML 1.0 rather than HTML 4.01, at least to have something
          from this decade/century.  The resulting documentation still
          does not fully validate (see #496724), I think that due to
          bugs/problems of docbook-xsl conversions using invalid elements in
          the different standards (tried HTML 4.0, 4.01, XHTML 1.0 and 1.1).
        * Generate 'alt' tag for images in HTML documentation (see #496724)
        * In "Customizing the package list", fix order of variables
          ::UI::Package-Status-Format and ::UI::Package-Header-Format and
          their explanations
    - User visible changes:
      * Slightly change description of shortcut 'g' in title bar
        (Closes: #247487)
    - Internal changes:
      * search_graph.h, fix problem with code which was working for many
        years (with boost 1.55 and many versions before), but now the
        straightforward option to convert boost::optional to bool does not
        work with gcc-5.2 and boost-1.58, so use .is_initialized() instead.
      * solution_item.cc, copy string of package name coming from libapt
        because it does not guarantee that the string is valid for all of the
        time span that we need it, to not show garbage that it happens
        sometimes (Closes: #795150, #795028)
      * match.cc, pkg_info_screen.cc, reason_fragment.cc: remove and
        modify code relying on pkg.Section() (from apt PkgIterator), it is
        deprecated code and it will get removed soon according to the apt team
        (Versions have Sections, Package in abstract doesn't have unique
        Sections)
      * aptitude_resolver.cc: use std::unique_ptr instead of deprecated
        SPtrArray
      * Add compatibility for APT 1.1:
        * Create DepIterator values from Dependency pointers on-the-fly,
          where required
        * Adjust AcqQueuedFile() for changed signatures of overriden
          methods
      * Improving C++11 compatibility mode:
        * Convert std::auto_ptr (deprecated in C++11) to unique_ptr
        * Convert boost::scoped_ptr (deprecated in C++11) to std::unique_ptr
        * Convert instances of boost::shared_ptr, make_shared, and
          weak_ptr to be explicitly prefixed by boost::, otherwise they clash
          or have problems compiling with the new C++11 std::shared_ptr and
          analogues (many were not converted in the previous version).
      * Remove unused function serialize_pattern_list()
      * Remove unused function wcsempty()
      * Improvements of the autoconf/automake infrastructure.
       * No more generate a dummy ChangeLog file just to please automake.
       * Clean up some more leftover files in "make maintainer-clean"
       * Use 'cp -u' when copying gtest and gmock, so they don't need to be
         recompiled every time
    - Translation updates:
      * Swedish by Josef Andersson (Closes: #792911)
      * Fix typos/syntax oddities and translation issues, thanks Jens Seidel
       (Closes: #381702)

  * Disable patches, now in the upstream release:

      Debtags browser has replaced most of its functionality already. Local
      package groups are no more available, though.  The removal discussion
      has taken place in #686646. (Closes: #686124, #686142, #686646 as

  * [all]: Support for matching architectures using specification
           strings and wildcards (for example, "linux-any").  See
           Debian Policy section 11.1 "Architecture specification
           strings" for more details.
  * [cmdline]: Fix typo which prevented installing tasks using the
               apt-get compatible syntax ("aptitude install
               gnome-desktop^").
  * [cmdline]: Do not assume that APT::Default-Release always provides
               the candidate version of a package, instead use the
               policy defined by apt_preferences(5).
               (Closes: #587775, #631464, #686316)
  * [all]: Download changelogs from APT::Changelogs::Server instead

aptitude (0.6.8-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix build with g++ 4.7
    Thanks Adrian Lang for the patch (Closes: #672335)
  * New binary packages:
    - aptitude-doc-it: Italian documentation (Closes: #674664)

  * debian/rules:
    - use dh (debhelper command sequencer)
  * Require libapt-pkg 0.9.3 to avoid "Method http has died
    unexpectedly" (Closes: #669322)
  * Removed preinst script, the one transition it handled is
    over ten years old.
  * New upstream release.
    - Update to tasks support: task packages, multi-arch, syntax

      Task packages (introduced with tasksel 3.0) are
      meta-packages which define the dependencies of tasks.  The
      packages themselves have always worked but the 'tasks'
      grouping policy and '?task' search term did not support
      them.  This update corrects for this.

      As a result of this change to tasksel all Debian tasks now
      function exactly like meta-packages. (Closes: #382631)

      The syntax for installing tasks from the command line has
      been updated.  It now supports specifying an arch and
      requires the same syntax as apt-utils ('^' must be the last
      part of the name).  Examples:

        # aptitude install gnome-desktop^
        # aptitude install ssh-server^:armel

      This avoids ambiguity that may arise when a task and
      package have the same name.
    - Changelog downloading is restored
      (Closes: #669569, LP: #824708)

    - Actually use aptitude::Logging::Levels (Closes: #654344)

    - No longer use ListUpdate (from libapt-pkg) to update package lists.
      Instead, restore the previous code and update it to include the
      semantics from ListUpdate which were missing.

      ListUpdate was too coarse to suit download_update_manager properly
      even though it more-or-less worked.

    - Do not call debtags on list update.  This was a rather unsightly
      kludge is better suited as a script for APT::Update::Post-Invoke.

    - Use arch-qualified names in 'Provided by' for virtual packages
      (LP: #972847)

    - Preview screen ignores Pkg-Display-Limit

      Previously it would apply that limit if UI::Preview-Limit was not
      set.  This was causing confusion and it is more useful to have these
      as two clearly distinct settings. (LP: #381507)

    - New translations:

      + Croatian (Closes: #667934)

  * Use export to really enable build hardening, etc.

      have been negated but were not.  Thanks to Modestas Vainius
      for this one. (Closes: #608786)

    - Fix some help and prompt strings which wrongly included
      localized names for commands such as 'why'.  (Closes: #486615)

    - Change ordering of top-level sections to match the order
      in aptitude::Sections::Top-Sections.  The default order
      is now: main, contrib, non-free.  (Closes: #181997)

    - Improve error messages when parsing grouping policies to
      use the user-visible names, rather than the internal
      names.  (Closes: #231595)

    - Change default width of %D, %I, %o, and %Z.  Thanks to
      MichaÅ‚ KuÅ‚ach for this one. (Closes: #599209) (LP: #741417)

    - Change default width of %V, %v to 14.  This greatly increases the
      number of versions which will display completely. (Closes: #624542)

    - 'versions' now groups it's results by 'package:arch' instead of
      'package'.

    - Cleared up grouping, sorting policy error messages.
      (Closes: #231595)

    - Minor correction to the user's manual. (Closes: #365485)

    Anyone interested in continuing either of the GTK+ or Qt interfaces
    should contact the mailing list:

aptitude (0.6.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.

    - aptitude no longer requires log4cxx; dropped that build dependency.

      I hope this will solve some of the random crashes, particularly
      on exit, that have been reported, but since they're unreproducible
      it's hard to know.

    - aptitude should build correctly against either the current ept
      release or the upcoming release (in experimental).
      (Closes: #581009)

  * Applied upstream patches to make the tests build when GTK+ is
    disabled.

  * Weakened the build dependency on libboost-dev, since this upstream
    release no longer requires 1.42.

  * aptitude now requries gtest and google-mock for its test suite;
    added build dependencies.

  * Add the compile flag -fno-gcse on s390; current g++ miscompiles some
    of aptitude's parse code without this. (Closes: #580085)

 -- Daniel Burrows <dburrows@debian.org>  Fri, 18 Jun 2010 23:40:26 -0700

aptitude (0.6.2.1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Tighten the dependency on libboost-dev to reflect the fact that
    aptitude needs at least 1.42.

    This caused actual build failures, so I'm surprised I didn't get bugs
    about it.  I don't know if this will be a permanent state of affairs;
    a configure test could take care of the one thing that's a serious
    problem (a published API reversed the order of its arguments (!)).

aptitude (0.6.2.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.

    - Fixes some backwards compatibility breakages in 0.6.2-2.

  * Weaken the Conflict against ia32-apt-get to (<< 22), on advice from
    Goswin von Bredrelow.  Apparently some people still use this package,
    and the "feature" that broke aptitude is not present in recent
    versions.

aptitude (0.6.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.

    - Includes the patch for #567242 to not crash when the user sets
      a rejection by package name and version at the command-line,
      previously backported.

    - Includes the patch for #566205 to make sure that download progress
      bars are deleted when the download is finished.

    - Don't crash in "aptitude changelog" when the package given on
      the command-line doesn't have a valid version (Closes: #567318).
      Thanks to Dmitry Semyonov for the patch.

 -- Daniel Burrows <dburrows@debian.org>  Sun, 18 Apr 2010 08:45:16 -0700

aptitude (0.6.1.5-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Backport changes from head to increase how long the resolver is
    permitted to run.  Fixes problems with some large upgrades where
    the resolver would time out and fail to find a solution.  The new
    limit is much larger than any reasonable upgrade should require (it
    was increased by a factor of 100, from a value that was just barely
    too small).

aptitude (0.6.1.5-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Backport patch from head to fix crashes when changing the settings of
    the command-line resolver (Closes: #567242).

aptitude (0.6.1.5-1) unstable; urgency=low

    - Make the resolver significantly less conservative, so major

    - Explicitly explain the implications of how the Linux command-line
      works in the aptitude manpage entry for "search" to reduce
      the confusion it causes. (Closes: #566003)

    - Fixes for multiple compile bugs (see NEWS for details);
      Closes: #531687, #560517, #559980, #555120

  * Add ${misc:Depends} to each binary package.

  * Build-depend on elinks instead of html2text since that's what the
    upstream Makefiles use.

  * Add a NEWS entry warning about the syntax break with "full-upgrade" to
    make its behavior saner and consistent with safe-upgrade.

 -- Daniel Burrows <dburrows@debian.org>  Mon, 12 Oct 2009 21:20:43 -0700

aptitude (0.5.9rc3-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.

    - On the command-line, package versions can be chosen by codename
      (Closes: #547707).

    - Switch back from dpkg-parsechangelog to parsechangelog; they both
      require an external dependency and parsechangelog is faster
      (Closes: #546280).

    - Don't crash if the Xapian database fails to load (Closes: #512998).

    - Recognize --no-gui in all builds, not just aptitude-gtk.
      (Closes: #546406)

    - Don't discard errors after dpkg fails (Closes: #548879, #548889).

    - Block SIGWINCH by default so nothing interferes with cwidget
      catching it. (Closes: #547212)

    - Mention build-dep in "aptitude help" (Closes: #547151).

    - Make --arch-only behave correctly (Closes: #547266).

    - Make the "hold" command in the GTK+ interface hold packages
      instead of deleting them (Closes: #549897).

    - Mention Get-Root-Command in the manual when it describes
      auto-switching-to-root. (Closes: #548657)

    - Fix the default value of Get-Root-Command in the manual so it
      matches the actual code. (Closes: #550057)

    - Translation updates:

      + Danish (Closes: #546497)
      + French
      + Portuguese
      + Russian (Closes: #535806)

aptitude (0.5.9rc1-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.

    - Use the new apt hooks to honor holds when autoresolving
      dependencies. (Closes: #177374, #205049, #374353, #376802, #406506,
      #430816, #434731, #442420, #452589)

    - Honor the configuration options APT::Get::List-Cleanup
      and APT::List-Cleanup in "aptitude update". (Closes: #448958)

    - Make "aptitude update" actually clean up the list download
      directories. (Closes: #507603)

    - The menu commands in the curses frontend to clean up the package
      cache and to delete obsolete files now support automatically becoming
      root. (Closes: #492832)

    - Make name-based searching the default again; the full-text search
      must be explicitly requested with ?term().
      (Closes: #506651, #507359, #514625, #527540, #534671, #538198)

    - Document that full-upgrade takes extra actions on the command-line.
      (Closes: #268696)

    - Document that the "standard" apt options
      Apt::AutoRemove::SuggestsImportant and
      Apt::AutoRemove::RecommendsImportant should be used instead of
      Aptitude::Keep-Suggests and Aptitude::Keep-Recommends.

    - Various crashing bugs should be fixed in this version or previous
      versions.

      (Closes: #506649, #507099, #525801, #527739, #539805)

    - Translation updates:

      + Czech (Closes: #545144)
      + French
      + Spanish

  * Compile against libraries currently in unstable again.
    (Closes: #545609)

  * Add a dependency on sensible-utils as a nicety. (Closes: #541847)

  * Downgrade the apt-xapian-index dependency to a Recommends.  I'm not
    sure that running aptitude without the Xapian index will actually work
    yet, but this will make it easy for people to test it out.
    (Closes: #516719)

  * Remove the no-longer-necessary recommendation of
    libparse-debianchangelog-perl; aptitude uses dpkg-parsechangelog now.

  * Add build dependencies on libboost-iostreams-dev and
    libboost-test-dev.

  * Change the description of aptitude-gtk to warn users that it's an
    experimental release.

  * Only install the "move the old aptitude state directory to the right
    place" stanza in the core aptitude package, rather than duplicating it
    in every preinst.

  * Make lintian stop complaining:

    - Bumped Standards-Version to 3.8.3 (no changes relevant to aptitude).
    - Tighten the debhelper Build-Dep to require 5.0.0.
    - Use set -e in the preinst script.

aptitude (0.5.2-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.

    - Support for guaranteed ordering of solutions produced by the
    dependency resolver. (Closes: #514820, #514930, #524221, #473296)

    - The dependency resolver will continue searching for a short time
      after finding a solution, in case a better solution turns up.
      (Closes: #482825)

    - The GTK+ interface should no longer crash while trying to find
      dependency chains. (Closes: #514714)

    - aptitude is now more careful about automatically canceling the
      removal of an unused package, to avoid triggering a conflict with
      other packages (for instance, packages included in a dependency
      solution). (Closes: #522881, #524667)

    - The curses interface no longer warns users when they purge an
      already-removed Essental package. (Closes: #513472)

    - The curses interface no longer computes an excessive amount of
      dependency information every time a package is highlighted.
      (Closes: #516296)

    - Fixed incorrect formatting in some command-line error messages.
      (Closes: #516296, #514676)

    - Fix really stupid column wrapping in "aptitude why".

  * Change the reportbug script to run in the C locale, so program output
    that's inserted doesn't get translated.

  * Change the description of aptitude-gtk to say that it has a GUI
    interface. (Closes: #514545, #521152)

  * Give aptitude-gtk a versioned dependency on aptitude. (Closes: #516527)

  * Include .desktop file contributed by Fabit Greffrath.  I know that
    using su-to-root is not ideal, but since aptitude-gtk can't be used to
    install / remove packages unless it's run as root, this is probably a
    good interim approach.  Eventually we'll hook up the code so that the
    GTK+ frontend can do what the curses frontend does (automagically
    become root and preserve selections). (Closes: #521255)

    - Don't annoy every Polish user with warnings about their
      aptitude-defaults file. (Closes: #483459)

    - Correctly handle install-and-mark-auto commands that
      are targeted at a particular version, like "foo/testing+M":
      don't just throw away the version information. (Closes: #490650)

    - Swedish translation updates. (Closes: #490782, #490818)

aptitude (0.4.11.8-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.

    - Fix an annoying and long-standing bug that caused aptitude
      to sometimes delete package lists if downloading new copies
      failed.  (Closes: #201842, #479620)

 -- Daniel Burrows <dburrows@debian.org>  Fri, 04 Jul 2008 09:34:16 -0700

aptitude (0.4.11.7-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.

    - Fix FTBFSes. (Closes: #488132)

    - Translation updates:
      + Basque
      + Portuguese (Closes: #482094)
      + Thai

aptitude (0.4.11.6-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.

 -- Daniel Burrows <dburrows@debian.org>  Sat, 21 Jun 2008 12:34:11 -0700

aptitude (0.4.11.5-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.

    - Forbid the resolver (by default) from producing solutions that remove
      Essential packages. (Closes: #486748)

    - Translation updates:

      + Dutch (Closes: #486858)
      + Romanian (Closes: #486934)

  * Tighten up the Build-Depends on libept-dev to fix a FTBFS.
    (Closes: #487227)

aptitude (0.4.11.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.

    - Fixed a nasty resolver bug that would cause solutions to be chosen
      poorly in some cases involving self-conflicts. (Closes: #483920)

    - "aptitude search" now takes a command-line argument
      "--disable-columns" that prevents aptitude from padding or
      truncating strings to line text up into columns.  This makes
      the output much more script-friendly.  (Closes: #136874)

    - Fixed the formatting of literal elements in the manpage.
      (Closes: #473580)

    - Defaults files for locales that contain an underscore (such as pt_BR
      or zh_CN) should get installed now. (Closes: #483620)

    - Translation update for Russian. (Closes: #483943)

  * aptitude-dbg recommends libcwidget3-dbg now, not libcwidget1-dbg.
    (Closes: #473829)

  * Bring the Standards-Version up-to-date.  No other changes were needed;
    the only change to Policy lately that affects aptitude was the
    restructuring of the menu hierarchy, and aptitude is already
    up-to-date with that.

  * Bring README.Debian up-to-date regarding the location of the upstream
    and Debian repositories.

 -- Daniel Burrows <dburrows@debian.org>  Sat, 07 Jun 2008 17:05:21 -0700

aptitude (0.4.11.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.

    - "aptitude unhold" should work now. (Closes: #477165)

    - Fixed almost complete breakage of "aptitude changelog". (Closes: #481458)

    - Fixed retrieving the changelogs of bin-nmued packages from the curses
      interface. (Closes: #333468)

    - Always be at least as quiet as the user requested that we be.
      (Closes: #476749)

    - Remove a stray hyphen in the output of --help. (Closes: #476835)

    - Fix the manpage to talk about Recommends-Important instead of
      Install-Recommends. (Closes: #480533)

    - Translation updates:
      * Brazilian Portuguese (Closes: #481007)

aptitude (0.4.11.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.

    - Fix XML errors in the manpage source. (Closes: #473722)

    - Don't crash if a package's Section field is empty. (Closes: #474115)

    - Rewrite the status information to avoid the need for choosing
      between the singular and plural forms of verbs. (Closes: #486186)

    - Added "why" and "why-not" to the output of "--help". (Closes: #454088)

    - Use a different technique to migrate "Recommends-Important" to
      "Install-Recommends" that doesn't overwrite the old option; instead
      the option "Aptitude::Ignore-Recommends-Important" is set to "true"
      when the setting is migrated; if this option is set, then
      Recommends-Important is ignored.

      This should be better for people who share configuration files
      between machines. (Closes: #473872)

    - Translation updates:
      * Galician (Closes: #474672)
      * Vietnamese (Closes: #473719)

  * New upstream release.

    - Don't crash if debtags has been purged (Closes: #472695).
    - Save interactive changes to string options. (Closes: #471315)
    - Don't print an error on startup if debtags is missing.
      (Closes: #472678)

aptitude (0.4.11-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Upload to unstable.
    - Built against the new cwidget (Closes: #472369).

  * Removed the dependency on diff.  As pointed out by lintian, diff is an
    Essential package and so depending on it is not just unnecessary, it's
    outright wrong.

 -- Daniel Burrows <dburrows@debian.org>  Mon, 24 Mar 2008 21:26:33 -0700

aptitude (0.4.11-2) experimental; urgency=low

  * Explicitly enable ept support.
  * Backport typo fixes to NEWS.
  * Backport fixes to test/test_tags.cc so it compiles with ept support.

 -- Daniel Burrows <dburrows@debian.org>  Sun, 16 Mar 2008 10:28:31 -0700

aptitude (0.4.11-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * Upload to experimental so as not to interfere with the installer.

  * New upstream release.

    - Handle conflicts/provides/replaces in the dependency resolver
      (Closes: #466374).

    - Implement a "build-dep" command to install build dependencies of one
      or more source packages. (Closes: #243317)

    - Implement support for multi-level sections, thanks to Paul Donahue
      for the patches.

    - Use libept to get debtags information. (Closes: #397652, #406201)

    - Fixed a case where aptitude would claim that packages could
      fulfill a versioned dependency through a Provides. (Closes: #464131)

    - Fix task handling in the case that different versions of a package
      have different task fields. (Closes: #459348)

    - Fix building with g++-4.3, assuming the build-deps support g++-4.3.
      (Closes: #452204, #452540)

    - Forcibly make the manual compile by allowing through a largely
      untranslated input. (Closes: #470054)

    - Migrate the setting for enabling installation of Recommends from
      Aptitude::Recommends-Important to Apt::Install-Recommends.
      (Closes: #458189, #448561)

    - Ensure that the resolver state is always synchronized with the
      state of the package cache, to eliminate some cases where it
      would break or produce wrong answers. (Closes: #421395, #432411)

    - Eliminate some crashes that occurred when removing packages at the
      command-line while version numbers were displayed (-V).
      (Closes: #459336, #461669)

    - If the package lists can't be read in "aptitude update", download
      new ones instead of crashing.  (Closes: #468751)

    - Document some of the files that aptitude uses in a FILES section
      in the manpage (Closes: #470839)

    - Fix the use of quote in the French translation (Closes: #460808).

  * Build-Depend on libept-dev for ept support.

 -- Daniel Burrows <dburrows@debian.org>  Sat, 15 Mar 2008 22:43:33 -0700

aptitude (0.4.10-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add a reportbug script that includes the user's $TERM in the bug.

  * Fix a typo in the aptitude description. (Closes: #452710)

  * Add VCS fields to the control file.

  * Build-Depend on the newest version of cwidget so we link against
    libcwidget1 instead of libcwidget0.

  * New upstream release.

    - Add an option --allow-untrusted to override trust warning.
      (Closes: #452201, #452541)

    - Recommended packages are now hidden if quiet mode is enabled.
      (Closes: #452202)

    - Fixed a segfault that would happen after updating the package lists
      or doing an install run.
        (Closes: #454695, #454700, #455349, #453362, #455865)

    - If StepLimit is 0, abort dependency resolution cleanly instead of
      going into an infinite loop. (Closes: #451311)

    - When visual mode is entered from the command-line (e.g., via
      --visual-preview), return a failing exit code if the last
      install run the user performs fails.

    - Return a failing exit code from "aptitude update" if any
      download fails. (Closes: #233129)

    - Checkboxes and radio buttons in the preferences tree will
      now toggle on both Space and Enter. (Closes: #451765)

    - Command-line searches will now only print each result once.
      (Closes: #450798)

 -- Daniel Burrows <dburrows@debian.org>  Sun, 16 Dec 2007 11:56:23 -0800

aptitude (0.4.9-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add a -dbg package. (Closes: #448884)

  * Generate aptitude-doc-ja. (Closes: #390859)

  * Talk about software package management, not apt, in the Description.

 -- Daniel Burrows <dburrows@debian.org>  Mon, 19 Nov 2007 18:29:45 -0800

aptitude (0.4.9-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.

    - Add a matcher for obsolete/local packages (Closes: #397547).

    - Don't swap around the name, description, and long description
      of configuration options. (Closes: #449138)

    - Don't remove *.gmo in distclean, hopefully fixing problems
      with translations in the Debian packages.
      (Closes: #451584, #441696)

 -- Daniel Burrows <dburrows@debian.org>  Sat, 17 Nov 2007 09:21:39 -0800

aptitude (0.4.8-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.

    - Fix display corruption of the broken packages indicator.
      (Closes: #448753)

  * This release needs cwidget (0.5.5 or greater due to errors in previous
    versions' include files); add an appropriate build-dep.

 -- Daniel Burrows <dburrows@debian.org>  Thu, 15 Nov 2007 21:58:20 -0800

aptitude (0.4.7-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.

    - Replaced the options "dialogs" with a list-based display that
      handles long string options more sanely.  As part of this, did work
      on string prompts; when the text being edited gets too long, the
      prompt will now expand vertically and wrap around.
      (Closes: #197976, #331200, #424708)

    - The online help is now a top-level view, so some of the problems
      with it should go away. (Closes: #434349)

    - Support for the "Breaks" field and for trigger states is now
      included.  Thanks to Michael Vogt and Ian Jackson for the patches
      and for prodding me to apply them. (Closes: #438543)

    - Display styles for downgraded packages are now available:
      "PkgDowngraded" and "PkgDowngradedHighlighted". (Closes: #434442)

  * Acknowledge NMU (Closes: #441696).

  * Add support for noopt builds (Closes: #433646).

  * Build against the new apt (Closes: #447960).

 -- Daniel Burrows <dburrows@debian.org>  Tue, 30 Oct 2007 21:41:00 -0700

aptitude (0.4.6.1-1.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Non-maintainer upload.
  * Removed "*.gmo" removal from the "distclean" target in po/Makefile.in.in
    to fix package content change on double-build (Closes: #441696).
  * Moved the menu entry from the "Apps/System" section to the
    "Applications/System/Administration" one.
  * No longer ignore "make distclean" errors, per lintian.

 -- Cyril Brulebois <cyril.brulebois@enst-bretagne.fr>  Sun, 30 Sep 2007 00:14:43 +0200

aptitude (0.4.6.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release (includes scripts I missed in the last release).

 -- Daniel Burrows <dburrows@debian.org>  Wed, 25 Jul 2007 22:06:15 -0700

aptitude (0.4.6-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.

  * Properly handle EINTR in the keyboard-input thread; should clear up
    the problems where aptitude becomes nonresponsive.
    (Closes: #431054, #431686, #432323)

  * Make sure the apt auto-mark flags get initialized on startup, so
    aptitude knows what's automatic and doesn't clear auto flags
    pointlessly. (Closes: #432017)

  * Don't crash on startup when something goes wrong early in the
    initialization process. (Closes: #430061)

  * Disable unused package removal if Delete-Unused is false.
    (Closes: #431716)

  * Don't garble translated descriptions in non-UTF8 locales.
    (Closes: #432911)

  * Eliminate another bogus warning about a supposedly locked
    cache. (Closes: #431909)

  * Translation updates:

    - Basque (Closes: #432535)
    - Vietnamese (Closes: #432283)

 -- Daniel Burrows <dburrows@debian.org>  Wed, 25 Jul 2007 21:39:50 -0700

aptitude (0.4.5.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Upload to unstable since aptitude has been binNMUed against the
    new apt, and this build (although there are still bugs) is less
    broken than that one.

  * Fix an out-of-bounds error in the line editor. (Closes: #429673)

  * Force aptitude to create the state file the first time it's run
    even if the user didn't install/remove anything, so it knows
    which packages are new. (Closes: #429732)

  * Translation updates:

    - Basque (Closes: #418862)
    - Galician (Closes: #429504)
    - Vietnamese (Closes: #429447)

  * Tidy up the Debian diff some more.

 -- Daniel Burrows <dburrows@debian.org>  Tue, 03 Jul 2007 07:18:03 -0700

aptitude (0.4.5.3-2) experimental; urgency=low

  * Trim the diff way down; it looks like the switch to Mercurial, or
    maybe some of the stuff I did in the past with the packaging
    repository, generated a bunch of spurious changes from upstream.

    There are still spurious additions of .xml DocBook files that are
    autogenerated by po4a.  These should be deleted by "make clean", but
    that needs to be fixed in the upstream code.

 -- Daniel Burrows <dburrows@debian.org>  Mon, 18 Jun 2007 17:08:17 -0700

aptitude (0.4.5.3-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * Thanks to everyone who tested the last release.  Hopefully this one is
    less buggy than it was.

  * Hopefully this release fixes a nasty race condition that caused
    garbled output. (Closes: #414838, #406193)

  * Fixed a bug that caused aptitude to keep trying to remove a package it
    had already removed. (Closes: #429388) Or rather, made it harder to
    trigger through normal usage; there's no clean way for anyone but
    dselect to keep track of package installation states.

  * Fix build errors in the code; build-depend on apt >= 0.7.0.
    (Closes: #429348)

  * Set packages to manual mode when the user cancels their removal, like
    old aptitudes did.  (Closes: #429271)

  * Fix compile failures with g++-4.3. (Closes: #413488)

 -- Daniel Burrows <dburrows@debian.org>  Sun, 17 Jun 2007 21:29:25 -0700

aptitude (0.4.5.2-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream version (fixes various bugs introduced by the code
    merge).

 -- Daniel Burrows <dburrows@debian.org>  Fri, 15 Jun 2007 21:34:18 -0700

aptitude (0.4.5.1-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.

  * This version merges in the code I wrote in 2005 to support the
    patch against apt to add removal of automatic patches.  aptitude
    should merge its list of "automatic" packages into the global apt
    list when it's run.

  * aptitude will now let you go ahead when there isn't anything to
    change, but some packages need to be configured. (Closes: #424709)

  * Translation updates:

    - French (Closes: #428585, #428826)
    - Portuguese (Closes: #425779)
    - Vietnamese (Closes: #426976)

  * Use debian/compat instead of DH_COMPAT; switch to debhelper
    compatibility level 5.

 -- Daniel Burrows <dburrows@debian.org>  Fri, 15 Jun 2007 08:53:06 -0700

aptitude (0.4.5-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * The "an entire pot of spaghetti gave its life for this upload"
    upload.

  * Re-enable werror (it should have always been enabled, but I turned
    it off during a period of brokenness and never turned it back on).

  * Rebuild against apt 0.7 (Closes: #428616).  This doesn't include
    support for the auto-mark code; I need to either forward-port
    my patches from 2005 or rewrite them.

  * Fix a number of crashes due to inconsistencies in aptitude's
    internal dependency model. (Closes: #420358, #420381, #420407)

  * Don't crash if some code generates a percentage that isn't strictly
    between 0 and 100; instead, just try to display it as best we can.
    (Closes: #425145)

  * 'N' now repeats the last search in the opposite direction from 'n'.
    (Closes: #414020, #397880)

  * aptitude now recognizes Apt::Get::AllowUnauthenticated as a
    synonym for Aptitude::Ignore-Trust-Violations. (Closes: #411927)

  * Increase the default value of StepScore to 70.  This should make
    aptitude less likely to wander off into exponentially expanding
    search trees. (Closes: #418385)

  * Automatically enable Keep-Recommends when --without-recommends is
    passed on the command-line.  As a practical matter, this means that
    --without-recommends no longer tries to remove a bunch of packages.
    (Closes: #143532)

  * Add DPKG_NO_TSTP to the environment when doing a package-configure run
    after something failed, so "Z" backgrounding works at the conffile
    prompt. (Closes: #367052)

  * Put packages that are both "new" and "upgradable" into the "upgradable
    packages" list instead of the "new packages" list. (Closes: #419999)

  * Eliminate some cases where aptitude would print an incorrect
    message about being unable to acquire a lock after some other
    error occurred. (Closes: #422700)

  * Never display more than one "really quit?" dialog box at once.
    (Closes: #411158)

  * Explicitly chmod the aptitude state file to mode 0644 after writing
    it, to avoid surprising results when it gets read back in.
    (Closes: #421809, #421811)

  * Print an error message if the user tries to supply arguments
    to commands where this makes no sense. (Closes: #411152)

  * Write "[Enter]" instead of "enter" in the media-change prompt.
    (Closes: #414777)

  * Remove *.gmo in distclean.  It should now be possible to build
    the Debian package twice in a row. (Closes: #424102)

  * Improve the description of Recommends-Important,
    Keep-Recommends, and Keep-Suggests; thanks to Stefan Kangas for
    his suggestions. (Closes: #405002)

  * Add some missing commands to the online help. (Closes: #402360)

  * Fix the alignment of text in the online help. (Closes: #399048)

  * Translation updates:
    - Basque (Closes: #418862)

aptitude (0.4.4-5~1) experimental; urgency=low

    * Eliminate the crashes due to inconsistencies in the dependency
      resolver. (Closes: #420358, #420381, #420407)

      Also added checks for errors that occur in the dependency resolution
      thread, so the program can cleanly generate an error message instead
      of blowing up, and improved the errors generated by consistency checks
      to include more context information.

    * Eliminated a crash with the revdep column generator (Closes: #420405).

    * Add DPKG_NO_TSTP to the environment when doing a package-configure run
      after something failed, so "Z" backgrounding works at the conffile
      prompt. (Closes: #357042)

    * Fix how bolding is performed in the docbook templates for manpages;
      this made the manpages completely unreadable when built with a newer
      Docbook (Closes: #415468, #416232).

aptitude (0.4.4-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * In addition to the bugfix for ssprintf, the last release included
    a new test case to ensure that the bug did not recur.  As it turned
    out, this test case revealed that both the old and the new code
    were buggy on amd64!  vssnprintf now handles its variable argument
    list properly, using va_copy in case it has to access the list a
    second time. (Closes: #414617)

aptitude (0.4.4-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Recompile to get translations back on i386. (Closes: #413698)

  * Fix a nasty problem that could cause aptitude to want to remove
    packages installed using apt-get or dpkg. (Closes: #411123)

    This is triggered by the installer, so probably this update
    should get into etch if possible.

  * Fix a bug in an internal "sprintf" variant that would include random
    characters in the output string sometimes (by reading from an
    allocated but uninitialized buffer).

  * French documentation update.

 -- Daniel Burrows <dburrows@debian.org>  Sun, 11 Mar 2007 09:14:40 -0700

aptitude (0.4.4-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * l10n and documentation release targeted at etch.  The following code
    fixes are also included:

    - Use delete[] to delete several arrays instead of plain
      delete.

    - Update the fix for signal blockage during configure to
      work when a package install fails (in which case the
      previous release ran dpkg --configure -a with signals blocked).

  * Many editorial fixes to the user's manual and updates to the
    Japanese translation by Noritada Kobayashi.  There is a Japanese
    version of the manual in the source tree, but this upload does not add
    a new documentation package.

  * The FSF's address in the manpage license has been fixed.

  * Don't generate two identical author lines in the manpage.
    (Closes: #397224)

      the yellow "progress" effect (which on many system just produces a
      distracting yellow and blue flashing) (Closes: #390971).

    - Unblock all signals (particularly WINCH) before running dpkg, so
      that processes spawned by dpkg don't end up with weird signal masks.

      packages if the removal is cancelled. (Closes: #254422)

    - All traces of Suggests-Important were removed from the program.

      ways of doing that now.
      (Closes: #245410)

    - The non-hierarchical tree mode is broken and shows no signs of
      being fixed; until it is fixed, aptitude will not use it.

      the old manpage has been superseded by a (pretty much identical)
      new manpage generated from DocBook :-/.  (Closes: #242304)

    - Fixed the display of ORed dependencies when describing reasons
      for a package's state. (Closes: #242663)

    - Improved the calculation of reasons for a package's state in the

      or unreadable. (Closes: #220732)

        (Closes: #143732)

      what the user asked us to do. (Closes: #141925, #141720, #222907)
    - Actually save options when the user hits "Ok".  (Closes: #216268)

    - Added i18n markings to many strings that were missing them.

    the first time the user opens the preferences dialog!  (one-line change)

aptitude (0.2.13-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    - Fixes some longstanding memory-handling-related crashes by not
      memcpy'ing std::strings.  Thanks to Peter Lundkvist and Sami Liedes
      for finding the cause of this bug.
      I may have missed some bugs that need to be closed by hand (this
      one had a lot of symptoms and was reported many times)
        Closes: #192073
    - Fixes abnormal exits in very specific circumstances.  (after
      updating the package list while viewing details about a package
      which vanished from the cache)  Thanks to Peter Lundkvist for the
      diagnosis.
        Closes: #109420
    - No longer prints incorrect flags. (Closes: #183462)
      Thanks to Seneca Cunningham for the diagnosis.
    - Translation updates to pt_BR by Andre Luis Lopes (Closes: #195755)
    - Should build with g++-3.3 now.  (Closes: #194424, #195514)
  * Change Build-Depends ito specify libsigc++-1.2-dev, since aptitude has
    been ported to libsigc++-1.2.
  * Call configure with --disable-werror, since ncurses is still broken.
    (see bug #195732)
  * Hack around changed behavior of configure wrt MKINSTALLDIRS.

 -- Daniel Burrows <dburrows@debian.org>  Mon, 12 May 2003 16:53:16 -0400

aptitude (0.2.12-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Rebuild against apt 0.5.5.  It looks like this apt is
    binary-compatible with 0.5.4.9, but better safe than sorry I say.

 -- Daniel Burrows <dburrows@debian.org>  Wed,  7 May 2003 14:22:46 -0400

aptitude (0.2.12-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.  Debian bugs closed in this release:

    - In the quick-help bar, indicate that "g" also removes packages.
      (Closes: #158966)
    - aptitude no longer remembers whether a package was to be reinstalled.
      (Closes: #167236, #121346)
    - Parsing of bold colors is fixed. (Closes: #168287)
    - "aptitude install <task-name>" installs all packages in the task.
      (Closes: #165624)
    - Added a (mostly untested) "-t" argument, which should behave in
      the same manner as apt-get's "-t" argument.  (Closes: #151583)
    - Included da.po updates from Morten Bo Johansen <mojo@image.dk> and
      pt_BR.po updates from Andre Luis Lopes <andrelop@ig.com.br>.
      (Closes: #171903, #162512)
    - Changed the Content-Type of fr.po, as requested by the translator.
      (Closes: #156616)
    - The information that's logged about the change in the total installed
      package size is human-readable.  (Closes: #154924)
    - Fixed a display bug when downloading really big packages.
      (Closes: #171903)
    - Documented the "M" and "m" keystrokes.  (Closes: #160936, #154000)
    - Deleted references to the "x" keystroke.  (Closes: #166571)

  * Wrote a logrotate script, so aptitude's log file should now be rotated
    monthly.  (Closes: #160795)

  * Update standards version.

  * debhelper 4.0.

 -- Daniel Burrows <dburrows@debian.org>  Mon, 10 Feb 2003 15:19:25 -0500

aptitude (0.2.11.1-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix the aptitude-wants-to-remove-dpkg bug by following pre-depends
  in the garbage collector.  This is a one-line fix. (Closes: #151701)

 -- Daniel Burrows <dburrows@debian.org>  Fri, 12 Jul 2002 22:36:21 -0400

aptitude (0.2.11.1-2) unstable; urgency=high

  * Er, evidently katie doesn't like capitalized urgencies.  This is the
  only change in this upload.

 -- Daniel Burrows <dburrows@debian.org>  Tue, 23 Apr 2002 16:06:02 -0400

aptitude (0.2.11.1-1) unstable; urgency=HIGH

  * New upstream release.  RM: this does not change a single line of code;
  it just updates the translations (the reason for the release; these
  translations had fallen way behind) and fixes a few minor typos
  in documentation.
    - Merged updated Polish translations from
      Michal Politowski <mpol@charybda.icm.edu.pl>.
      (Closes: #143051)
    - Merged updated Finnish translations from
      Jaakko Kangasharju <ashar@iki.fi>.
    - Included information about aptitude's CVS in the README
      (Closes: #141371)
    - Fixed the dangling reference to SEARCHING in the manpage
      (Closes: #142651)

 -- Daniel Burrows <dburrows@debian.org>  Sun, 21 Apr 2002 23:53:49 -0400

aptitude (0.2.11-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
    - Not quite a Debian bug, but IMPORTANT: I have made the "new" command
      style the default!  If you have modified your configuration this should
      not be an issue, but if you haven't and you prefer the old style, look
      in the "UI Options" menu.
    - Translations are probably all screwed up in this release; many strings
      changed.  Sorry :-(
    - The Y/n command-line prompt now is more capable: you can enter the
      full UI or modify package selections from it.  Enter '?' at it for a
      complete description.  (Closes: #136916)
    - The '+' keybinding is no longer used to reinstall packages, ever.
      Use 'L' if you really want to reinstall something. (Closes: #138122)
    - An "unhold" command is now available from the command-line.
      (Closes: #137770)
    - A tripartite joeyh bug:
      * Tasks and sections which have 'descriptions' now display them in
        the "long description area".  (some of the descriptions I've written
        for sections are a bit hokey, though)
      * The Tasks tree previously hid many packages due to a parsing bug,
        making it virtually useless.  This is now fixed.
      * The "alien" section has a description now.
        (Closes: #136684)
    - Added a %H escape for display areas.  It expands to the current
      computer's hostname.  (Closes: #137754)
    - In command-line mode, suppress the prompt on upgrades when there are
      no actions to be taken.  (Closes: #137302)
    - Fixed a bug that caused packages being reinstalled to not be listed
      in the preview screens.  (Closes: #138120)
    - Fixed (read: rewrote to dehackify) the description widget's formatting
      code.  (Closes: #137783)
    - If the user aborts an update, the cache is reloaded before returning to
      the display.  (Closes: #138070)
    - The default value of autoclean is really "false" again.
      (Closes: #138685)
    - Fixed a rather nasty segfault due to running off the end of the package
      list.  How I didn't notice this for so long, I don't know.
      (Closes: #136967)
    - Eliminated an infinite loop that occured if the user tried to scroll
      the description while it was hidden.  (Closes: #140361)
    - The "install" command-line option now checks whether you entered a valid
      package name before deciding whether to treat trailing '+'/'-'/'_'/'='
      characters as commands.  (Closes: #140933)
    - You can no longer focus an unscrollable description widget, and the
      highlight bar in the package tree is hidden when the tree loses focus.
      (Closes: #136550)
    - "aptitude --help" now documents the "download" command.
      (Closes: #138150)
    - The status messages on startup are now suppressed when using
      "aptitude search".  (Closes: #136873)
    - When the download is stalled, "stalled" is now displayed in the progress
      bar (Curses frontend only)  (Closes: #136520)
    - The command-line mode deals correctly with window resizes now.
      (Closes: #137945)
    - No longer displays an "available" version for obsolete/local packages.
      (Closes: #120872)
    - aptitude now recognizes the "--version" option.  (Closes: #141296)

 -- Daniel Burrows <dburrows@debian.org>  Sun,  7 Apr 2002 10:02:50 -0400

aptitude (0.2.10-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
    - You can now access many features of aptitude from the command line.
      See "aptitude help" and/or aptitude(1) and/or the README for details.
    - The "p" package state is documented (Closes: #135112)
    - Sorted out the ~r matcher status.  Some people like the old behavior,
     so it's been reinstated; you can find out what packages would be
     or have been garbage-collected via ~g now.  (Closes: #135571)
    - Fixed a minor display bug in the download summary: the total time
     always had an extra "s" appended to it.  (Closes: #135567)
    - Removed the INSTALLATION section from the manual.  On the other
     hand, the space it used is more than taken up by the documentation for
     the new command-line stuff.  I could move that elsewhere -- let me
     know what you think, Joey.  (Closes: #136478)

 -- Daniel Burrows <dburrows@debian.org>  Sat,  2 Mar 2002 21:29:06 -0500

aptitude (0.2.9.4-2) unstable; urgency=high

  * Backported a fix from CVS for a nasty interaction when the user
  tried to follow Suggests and remove unused packages at the same time.
    This doesn't fix all the issues, but it gets rid of the most
  immediate problem.  A more complete fix may be hashed out in the future.
    (Closes: #135956)

 -- Daniel Burrows <dburrows@debian.org>  Wed, 27 Feb 2002 09:12:18 -0500

aptitude (0.2.9.4-1) unstable; urgency=high

  * New upstream release
    - Fixed crashing bug on Alpha due to divide-by-zero.
      This made aptitude much less useful on alpha machines, hence the
    high urgency.
     (Closes: #122064)
    - forget-new-on-update and forget-new-on-install now actually work.
     (Closes: #134226)

 -- Daniel Burrows <dburrows@debian.org>  Sun, 17 Feb 2002 10:44:57 -0500

aptitude (0.2.9.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

aptitude (0.2.9.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
    - ~ahold now does the Right Thing[tm].  (Closes: #126800)

 -- Daniel Burrows <dburrows@debian.org>  Sat,  9 Feb 2002 15:53:38 -0500

aptitude (0.2.9.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release

 -- Daniel Burrows <dburrows@debian.org>  Sat,  9 Feb 2002 11:43:08 -0500

aptitude (0.2.9-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.  Debian bug-related changes:
    - aptitude now tracks automatically installed packages, similarly
      to deborphan/debfoster.  (Closes: #122726, #102205, #114464)

    - Packages which are held, but not broken, are now visually flagged
      as being broken.  I believe this is enough of a fix for this
      particular bug.  (Closes: #120785)

      There is more to do in general, but there are other bugs filed
      about that :)

    - Log messages now include the date and time.  (Closes: #120874)

    - Re-ordered the preview screen's grouping to hopefully put more
      interesting things first and be more logical.  Feedback requested.
      (Closes: #128542)

    - Rewrote several sections of the documentation, incorporating some
      user feedback (Closes: #126492)  There may be more work to do here.

    - Mark all upgradable packages to be upgraded BEFORE resolving
      dependencies.  This fixes a somewhat complex misbehavior
      involving ORed version-specific dependencies.  (Closes: #108379)

    - Changed the symbols for collapsed/opened trees to something that I
      hope is less ambiguous.  (Closes: #120890, #102033)

    - When editing a string, the cursor now starts at the beginning
      of the line.  (Closes: #120890)

    - When reconfiguring packages, the software fails more gracefully if
      /usr/sbin/su-to-root does not exist.  (Closes: #130423)

    - Really made translated header widths work (I tested it this time! :) )
      (Closes: #114401)

    - Corrected a misspelling in the options dialog (Closes: #120887)

    - Fixed a misspelling in de.po (Closes: #123644)

    - Fixed a minor display bug when a package category was both longer
      than the width of the display, and the last item on the display.
      (Closes: #123652)

 -- Daniel Burrows <dburrows@debian.org>  Sat,  9 Feb 2002 11:24:08 -0500

aptitude (0.2.8.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
    - Matcher added for packages which are not depended upon.  (bug #122726)
      Not closing the bug, as there is more to do in this area.

    - The pause after downloading is now optional.  (Closes: #120873)

    - Package data moved to /var/lib. (FHS fix -- the package *ought* to
    handle the transition properly)  (Closes: #122334)

    - Fixed description of the "comm" section to show that it's not just
    faxmodems.  (Closes: #121951)

    - The descriptions of "j" and "k" were reversed in the help text.
    (so it said that "j" moved up and "k" moved down)  This has been fixed.
    (Closes: #122061)

    - Updated pt_BR with patch from Andre Luis Lopes <andrelop@ig.com.br>.
    (Closes: #122251)

 -- Daniel Burrows <dburrows@debian.org>  Sun,  9 Dec 2001 16:51:30 -0500

aptitude (0.2.8-4) unstable; urgency=high

  * Rebuild to kill the stray config.cache that somehow snuck into the
  Debian diff.  (Closes: #122890)  Urgency=high to get this RC fix safely
  into woody.

 -- Daniel Burrows <dburrows@debian.org>  Sun,  9 Dec 2001 09:48:38 -0500

aptitude (0.2.8-3) unstable; urgency=low

aptitude (0.2.8-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Backported patch to improve incsearch behavior: it now
  reverts to the starting location if an invalid (or, eg, null) pattern
  is provided.

 -- Daniel Burrows <dburrows@debian.org>  Thu, 22 Nov 2001 11:14:46 -0500

aptitude (0.2.8-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    - Doesn't crash if tasksel is missing, and Recommends tasksel.
      (Closes: #120578)
    - Correctly uses translated column widths.
      (Closes: #114401)
  * Never mind, aptitude wasn't added to base after all.  (too close to
  freeze)  Bugfixing like mad anyway; Thanksgiving vacation only happens
  once a year!

 -- Daniel Burrows <dburrows@debian.org>  Wed, 21 Nov 2001 21:08:55 -0500

aptitude (0.2.7.3-2) unstable; urgency=low

  work right.

aptitude (0.2.7.2-1) unstable; urgency=high

  * New upstream release
    - Should run at a decent speed on low-memory systems again.
      (Closes: #116750)
    - "f" is mentioned in mine-help.txt (Closes: #120251)
  * Urgency high because aptitude was just added to base (woohoo!) and
  base freezes very soon (bummer) and the efficiency issue above will
  make aptitude virtually unusuable on many older systems. (bleach)

 -- Daniel Burrows <dburrows@debian.org>  Tue, 20 Nov 2001 20:07:59 -0500

    - Translations are back in the package (Closes: #111904)

aptitude (0.2.6-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * The "deity is kaput" upload.  I was going to wait until the previous
  upload went into testing, but deity is not being fixed and not being
  fixed...which seems to be keeping the new apt and thus the new aptitude
  out of testing.  Bleah.

  * New upstream release
    - Fixed the situation with Default-Grouping being undocumented and
    overriding the preview grouping.  Closes: #110704
    - Fixed matching with ~ahold and ~areinstall.  Closes: #111466
    - It's tempting to close 104092, because the categorical browser
    has bad lynx-like bindings...but they suck and aren't consistent
    with the rest of the program.  So there.

aptitude (0.2.5.3-3) unstable; urgency=high

  * The "hey, Mr. Testing Bot, please move my code soon!" upload.
  * Backported fixes from CVS:
    - Deleted some nasty debug code that didn't compile on ia64.
    (Closes: #110438)
    - Finally found and fixed the (simple and stupid) bug that was
    preventing autoclean-on-update from working properly.
     (Closes: #108565)
  * Urgency high.  Yes, this is an evil hack.  But these changes will
    not break aptitude, and I intend to upload a version containing massive
    changes as soon as this is safely in testing.

 -- Daniel Burrows <dburrows@debian.org>  Thu, 30 Aug 2001 10:24:28 -0400

aptitude (0.2.5.3-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * The "A pox on deity-devel@debian.org" upload.
  * So the deity folks kindly went and bumped the soname, thus breaking all
  software compiled against previous versions.  So aptitude has to be
  recompiled.  (and I was so close to getting into testing, too.. :( )
  Closes: #109449

 -- Daniel Burrows <dburrows@debian.org>  Tue, 21 Aug 2001 19:15:41 -0400

aptitude (0.2.5.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    - Oops, getopt_long returns an int, not a char.  Storing it in an int
    lets the program compile on ppc.  (Closes: #107525)
    - Added a #include that's needed to compile on the Hurd.  (Closes: #107672)

 -- Daniel Burrows <dburrows@debian.org>  Mon,  6 Aug 2001 16:52:44 -0400

aptitude (0.2.5.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    - Hopefully, the endianness issues on alpha are now fixed, although
    I suppose there's a chance they'll reach out from the grave to
    throttle me..  (Closes: #106588)

 -- Daniel Burrows <dburrows@debian.org>  Fri, 27 Jul 2001 20:27:43 -0400

aptitude (0.2.5.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
    - The horrible, ugly, terrible, never-should-have-happened-in-a-megayear
    bug which caused most line-entries to crash has been fixed.  Mea culpa.
    (Closes: #106378)

 -- Daniel Burrows <dburrows@debian.org>  Tue, 24 Jul 2001 00:08:18 -0400

aptitude (0.2.5-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
    - Multi-CD installs work.  Closes: #104236
    - When editing the grouping policy, the current policy is displayed
    as a default.  Closes: #103962
    - Replaced the welcome dialog box with a less obtrusive list of
    keybindings at the top of the screen.  Closes: #104483

 -- Daniel Burrows <dburrows@debian.org>  Mon, 23 Jul 2001 09:14:54 -0400

aptitude (0.2.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    - Compiles and seems to work with g++-3.0.  Closes: #104723
  * DH_COMPAT=2, so we really build on potato/Progeny.  (I don't even know
  offhand what DH_COMPAT=3 does, but it doesn't seem to be important for this)
  Also, only build-depend on debhelper >=2.0.0.

 -- Daniel Burrows <dburrows@debian.org>  Thu, 19 Jul 2001 09:59:17 -0400

aptitude (0.2.3-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release
    - Media-change messages should now fit on the screen (a better
    fix is still needed)
    - The package list will retain its selection upon being resized.
    Closes: #103963
    - Fixed a crash triggered by a word in a package description
    longer than the width of the screen.  (libhtml-munger-perl was
    the culprit)  Closes: #103961
    - Mark broken dependencies using text as well as color.  Closes: #79047
    - Make the menubar visible when no screen is active, even if it's set
    to autohide.  Closes: #102918
    - Changing a package's status should advance to the next package.
    Closes: #104209
    - aptitude can now automatically become root (with the root password,
    of course) -- I believe this should address the issue of starting it
    from the Debian menu.  Closes: #71948

 -- Daniel Burrows <dburrows@debian.org>  Wed, 11 Jul 2001 12:15:11 -0400

aptitude (0.2.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
    - Default widths are now modifiable by the translator.  Closes: #101406

 -- Daniel Burrows <dburrows@debian.org>  Fri, 29 Jun 2001 14:36:57 -0400

aptitude (0.2.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
    - CD-ROM installs should work now.  Closes: #98956
    - Really fixed signedness issues.  Closes: #101398,#101504
    - Options are autosaved now.  Closes: #102599

  * Maintainer address changed to @debian.org
  * Removed beta-software warnings from the package description.

 -- Daniel Burrows <dburrows@debian.org>  Thu, 28 Jun 2001 15:24:15 -0400

aptitude (0.2.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.  This is still missing a few things -- in
    particular, some translators haven't caught up yet.
  * This one goes into unstable.  Much rejoicing (I hope)
  * libsigc++-dev added to Build-Depends, since we need it now.

  * I believe that the code to prevent installation from proceeding
    while packages are broken will avoid these situations where the
    problem resolver does stuff behind the user's back.
    Closes: #87774, #96559
  * Most of the code has been rewritten.  If these old bugs and
    crashes are still around, it's pure coincidence, and I can't reproduce
    any of them.  (I suspect they weren't even present in the latest 0.0.x
    revision)
    Closes: #60156, #63358
  * I believe that all known problems with displaying dependencies have
    been addressed.  Closes: #68628
  * I'm sure that aptitude purges itself completely by now.  Closes: #66711
  * The download progress screen has been rewritten, and will now scroll
    to keep the currently downloading item in view.  Closes: #69131
  * Errors are now collected into a single big dialog box, so even if
    there are hundreds, there's no confusion about whether the program
    crashed.  (incidentally, I still can't figure out where this
    "tried to dequeue a fetching object" comes from) Closes: #71314
  * Essential: yes packages are now hard to remove (at least when you
    first select them..if they get removed by the problem resolver, you
    won't get asked, but that should be hard to do.  Closes: #86115
  * I think most of the problems with bad search patterns are finally
    fixed (knock on wood)  This one is, at least.  Closes: #95455
  * I believe that the restructuring of the UI also eliminated the
    occasional crashes when installing from an info screen.  (knock on
    wood again)  Closes: #100187
  * Fixed the signed-char problems from 0.1.9.  Closes: #101398
  * The rewritten download progress screen should report 404 errors.  At
    least, it works for me..  Closes: #102109
  * You can now ask aptitude to run an autoclean operation after updating
    the package lists (which I think is the right time to do it)
    Closes: #97653
  * Prompt-On-Exit has been fixed since 0.1.9.  Closes: #101394
  * This includes Michal Politowski's new Polish translations.
    Closes: #101403

aptitude (0.1.9-2) experimental; urgency=low

  * Clobber some unnecessary files (the package build now replaces them with
  symlinks)  (Closes: #10388)

 -- Daniel Burrows <dburrows@debian.org>  Mon, 18 Jun 2001 20:43:01 -0400

aptitude (0.1.9-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release

  * This is probably going to be the last release before 0.2.0 (the
  version numbers worked out conveniently for once); please tell me if
  you think there are bugs which need to be fixed before I release this
  for general use!

 -- Daniel Burrows <dburrows@debian.org>  Mon, 18 Jun 2001 08:50:34 -0400

aptitude (0.1.8-1) experimental; urgency=low

aptitude (0.1.5-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.
    - addresses bug #95455, dealing with bad search patterns and reported by
      William Steve Applegate <wsapplegate@postmaster.co.uk>)

 -- Daniel Burrows <dburrows@debian.org>  Fri, 27 Apr 2001 22:29:52 -0400

 -- Daniel Burrows <dburrows@debian.org>  Tue, 10 Apr 2001 08:13:57 -0400

aptitude (0.1.3-2) experimental; urgency=low

  * Make the extended description less inflammatory, and fix dumb indentation.

 -- Daniel Burrows <dburrows@debian.org>  Fri, 23 Mar 2001 20:28:34 -0500

aptitude (0.1.3-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.  This will go into experimental as "aptitude";
    aptitude-beta is now an empty package depending on it.  (I was holding
    this out of experimental because apt wasn't up to handling
    experimental nicely and because it wasn't really even up to that.
    Both reasons are no longer valid.  Hence this goes into experimental)
  * Add build-depends, and don't install INSTALL.
    (was in stable, but I missed fixing it here)

 -- Daniel Burrows <dburrows@debian.org>  Fri, 23 Mar 2001 17:54:26 -0500

 -- Daniel Burrows <Daniel_Burrows@brown.edu>  Sun,  3 Dec 2000 22:49:59 -0500

aptitude (0.0.7.12-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.  Installation of a single package without affecting
   others is now (slightly hackily) supported; it can't be done in a much
   better way, unfortunately, although a few improvements will happen in the
   future.  (closes: #74824)

  * New upstream release
   (closes: #71844, #71161, #71091, #71558, #62368)

  * This ought to be linked with ncurses5 (closes: #69341)

 -- Daniel Burrows <Daniel_Burrows@brown.edu>  Sat, 23 Sep 2000 09:17:48 -0400

aptitude (0.0.7.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * This one will hopefully go into the Debian archives..

  * New upstream release (Closes: #61315, #64518)
   (of course, this isn't a real Debian package, and so these bugs
    might not actually get closed... I'm tempted to also finalize 60156,
    62368, 63358, and 66711, just on the grounds that the reports are using
    ancient/doogieized versions and/or failed to respond to requests for
    more info, but that wouldn't be nice now would it?)

  * Eliminated a lot of unneeded cruft in debian/

 -- Daniel Burrows <Daniel_Burrows@brown.edu>  Thu,  3 Aug 2000 18:49:17 -0400
